University of Cambridge OPD
===========================

This small repository contains the University of Cambridge's [Organisation Profile Document (OPD)](http://opd.data.ac.uk/), `cambridge.ttl`, which is made available at [www.cam.ac.uk/.well-known/openorg](https://www.cam.ac.uk/.well-known/openorg).

It uses [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to check the syntax of the file. Note that this doesn't check that the content is actually meaningful (use the [online checker](http://opd.data.ac.uk/checker) when making changes instead).
